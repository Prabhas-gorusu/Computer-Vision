🖐️ Hand Gesture Controlled Calculator

A virtual calculator controlled using hand gestures via a webcam, built with OpenCV and MediaPipe.
This project allows you to perform basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) by pinching your thumb and index finger over calculator buttons displayed on the screen.


✨ Features

👆 Hover over calculator buttons using your index finger.

🤏 Pinch gesture (thumb + index finger) to press a button.

🔢 Supports digits 0-9 and operations +, -, *, /.

✅ Includes C (Clear) and = (Evaluate) functions.

🎨 Interactive UI with transparent buttons and pressed effects.

🖼️ Calculator frame is fixed at the top-right corner of the webcam feed.




🛠️ Tech Stack

Python 3.x

OpenCV – for computer vision & UI rendering

MediaPipe Hands – for real-time hand landmark detection

NumPy – numerical operations

Math & Time modules – distance calculation and click delay handling
